# Scripts

## ⚠️ Archive Notice

In 2017, I had the idea of having a universal script that I would put at the end of all websites I build for clients as a freelancer. This way, if I ever needed to add something (like a "Designed by") note on all websites, I can do that without having to edit websites I probably don't have access to anymore. This repo contains an empty script at a fixed URL I never ended up using.
